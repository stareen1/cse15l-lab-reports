# Lab Report 4 (Week 7)
*Week 6 Lab Material*

## Part 1
**Task: In DocSearchServer.java, change the name of the start parameter of getFiles, and all of its uses, to instead be called base.

```
/start<Enter>
```
![Image](start_enter.png)

First we search for start in the file.


```
ce
```

Then we delete the word start in insert mode.

```
base<Escape>
```
![Image](base.png)

We replace start with the word base and escape to go back into normal mode.

```
n.n.n.
```
![Image](n1.png)
![Image](n2.png)
![Image](n3.png)

We type n to go to the next occurence of start and click . to repeat the previous commands. We do this 3 times because there are 3 more starts in the file.
