## Researching Commands

**Grep Options: Searches to find files with the given string and prints the matching lines**

This command printed out the file paths with a number indicating the counts of the number of lines that matched the given string in the command. This is useful when trying to find out how many matching lines there are without actually seeing the lines. 

```

This command can be used on specific directories within the main directory as well. 

```

This command can also be used on specific names in texts.

*-h shows matching lines without file paths*

This command prints out the lines that have the matching string in the files. This is very useful is you don't want all the extra paths that distract from the text.

This command can also be used with multiple words in a string for more detailed searches.

This command can also be used for wider searches by searching through multiple directories. 

*-v prints out all the lines that do not match the string*

This command printed out all the lines in the specified files that did not have the string "police" in them. This can be useful when you are trying to format a file for example and want to find lines that may not match a pattern in order to fix them.

This command is probably most useful for a small number of files if not many lines have the specified string in them. This command took almost 30 seconds to run through all the lines in this directory!

        Introduction
        Older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight,
        even though there is little evidence that overweight is
        associated with increased mortality in those over age 65.
        Six large controlled population-based studies of
        non-smoking older adults have investigated the association
        between body mass index (BMI) and mortality, controlling
        for relevant covariates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] . All studies found
        excess risk for persons with very low BMI, but that persons
        with moderately high BMI had little or no extra risk except
        in certain small subsets. A review of 13 studies of older
        adults drew similar conclusions [ 7 ] .

This command can also be used on one specific file. However, there was still a lot of output printed so this command may be more useful in smaller files or in files where most of the lines will have the specified string.
